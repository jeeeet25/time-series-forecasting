# Time Series Forecasting Project

## Overview

This project focuses on time series forecasting using the Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES) method and highlights the reasons why SES may not be suitable for certain types of time series data. It also recommends an alternative approach using the Holt-Winters method for more accurate forecasting when dealing with data that exhibits trends and seasonality.

## Introduction

Time series forecasting is an essential tool in data analysis and decision-making. This project explores the Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES) method and its limitations in handling time series data with trends and seasonality. It then recommends the use of the Holt-Winters method for improved forecasting accuracy in such cases.

## Key Limitations of Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)

1. **Upward Trend**: SES is not suitable for data with clear upward or downward trends, as it assumes stationary data.

2. **Inability to Capture Changing Trends**: SES assigns equal weight to all prior observations, making it inadequate for evolving trends.

3. **Inability to Capture Seasonality**: SES does not account for seasonality in data, leading to inaccurate forecasts for seasonal patterns.

4. **Stability Issues**: SES can produce unstable forecasts when dealing with data that contains outliers or extreme values.

## Why Holt-Winters is More Suitable

The Holt-Winters method is recommended for this project because it can handle time series data with trends and seasonality effectively. It incorporates three components (level, trend, and seasonality) to provide more accurate forecasts and adapt to changing patterns in the data.
